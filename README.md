# Predicting customer satisfaction (Invistico Airlines)

## Purpose
Apply supervised machine learning models to accurately predict customer dissatisafction and calculate feature importances, such that targeted customer loyalty schemes and specific services can be priortieed for improvement.

## Skills demonstrated
Data analysis and visualization using pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
Machine learning using scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier (and xgb's XGBClassifier), as well as other tools for model optimisation and evaluation provided by scikit-learn.

## User instructions
Read [overview report](https://github.com/dilraj451/Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediction/blob/main/report.pdf). If you wish to view further details/code, navigate through the [Jupyter Notebook](); if you wish to run any cells to experiment for yourself, ensure that you begin with the first and run them in order.

## Conclusion
Recall values of ~93% by both machine learning models massively surpoasses baseline model and is comparable to high quality models in similar classification scenarios. Averaged feature importance data indicates inflight entertainment, seat comfort, and ease of online booking are the three most importnat services impacting passenger satisfaction.
